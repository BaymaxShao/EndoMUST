# EndoMUST: Monocular Dpth Estimation for Robotic <ins>Endo</ins>scopy via <ins>Mu</ins>ltistage <ins>S</ins>elf-supervised <ins>T</ins>raining
Here is the pre-released code implementation for "**EndoMUST: Monocular Depth Estimation for Robotic Endoscopy via Multistage Self-supervised Training**". 

We revisit the self-supervised training strategy for endoscopy depth estimation, to jointly tackle all kinds of challenges.

:newspaper: **News:**
- [X] ðŸš© Evaluation Code and Weights have been Released.
- [ ] :dart: The further work on sim-to-real is on-going.

## Installation
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

:computer: Our implementation system: 
- Ubuntu 22.04
- NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4090 GPU (At least 24GB GPU memory)
- Pytorch 2.0.0 + CUDA 11.8

Our environment packages: in [env.yaml](env.yaml)

:heavy_exclamation_mark: (Some packages are used for implementation of existing works, e.g. `mmengine` for MonoViT used in MonoPCC and DVSMono.)

:file_folder: You also need dowloading the [pretrained Depth Anything-B model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/tree/main/checkpoints) into ./pretrained_model

## Datasets
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

The experiments are implemented on two main-stream **public** endoscopic datasets :file_folder: for self-supervised depth estimation and zero-shot depth estimation.
- **SCARED dataset**: Train/Validation/Evaluation [Website](https://endovissub2019-scared.grand-challenge.org/)

- **Hamlyn dataset**: Zero-shot Evaluation [Website](http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/)

_**Sincerely thanks for their great contributions to the community!!!**_

## Evaluation of Depth Estimation
[Back to ToC](#table-of-content)

Firstly, the ground truth of depth maps in SCARED dataset needs to be exported by the following code.
```
python export_gt_depth.py --data_path <your data path>
```
Then, you can use the following code to evlauate various models on datasets:
```
python evaluate_depth.py --data_path <your data path> --eval_mono --eval_split <dataset> --model_type <model used for eval> --load_weights_folder <weight path> \
--lora_type <method for LoRA> --learn_intrinsics <with/without camera intrinsics> --visualize_depth
```

`--eval_split`: SCARED dataset---`endovis`  Hamlyn dataset---`hamlyn` 

`--visualize_depth`: if you don't want to visualize the qualitative resullts, delete it when running.

The **arguments setting** for different models are shown as the following table:

|Models|`--model_type`|`--lora_type`|`--learn_intrinsics`|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Ours/Ablations|`endomust`|`dvlora`|`True`|
|EndoDAC|`endodac`|`dvlora`|`True`|
|MonoPCC|`pcc`|`none`|`False`|
|DVSMono|`pcc`|`none`|`False`|
|IID-SfMLearner|`afsfm`|`none`|`False`|
|AF-SfMLearner|`afsfm`|`none`|`False`|
|Depth Anything v1/v2|`depthanything`|`none`|`False`|

## Evaluation of Ego-motion and Camera Intrinsics Estimation
[Back to ToC](#table-of-content)

Firstly, the ground truth of ego-motion sequences needs to be exported by the following code.
```
python export_gt_pose.py --data_path <your data path> --sequence <sequence to export>
```
Note that `--sequence` needs to be set as `sequence1`, `sequence2`, `sequence3` one by one

Then, you can use the following code to evlauate various models on all three sequences:
```
python evaluate_pose.py --data_path <your data path> --eval_mono --eval_split <dataset> --load_weights_folder <weight path> --learn_intrinsics <with/without camera intrinsics>
```
The **arguments settings** are similar to the settings for depth estimation, without `--model_type` and `--visualize_depth`.
