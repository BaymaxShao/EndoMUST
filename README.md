# EndoMUST: Monocular Dpth Estimation for Robotic <ins>Endo</ins>scopy via <ins>Mu</ins>ltistage <ins>S</ins>elf-supervised <ins>T</ins>raining
Here is the pre-released code implementation for "**EndoMUST: Monocular Depth Estimation for Robotic Endoscopy via Multistage Self-supervised Training**". 

We revisit the self-supervised training strategy for endoscopy depth estimation, to jointly tackle all kinds of challenges.

:newspaper: **News:**
- [X] ðŸš© Evaluation Code and Weights have been Released.
- [ ] :dart: The further work on sim-to-real is on-going.

## Installation
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

:computer: Our implementation system: 
- Ubuntu 22.04
- NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4090 GPU (At least 24GB GPU memory)
- Pytorch 2.0.0 + CUDA 11.8

Our environment packages: in [env.yaml](env.yaml)

:heavy_exclamation_mark: (Some packages are used for implementation of existing works, e.g. `mmengine` for MonoViT used in MonoPCC and DVSMono.)

:file_folder: You also need dowloading the [pretrained Depth Anything-B model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/tree/main/checkpoints) into ./pretrained_model

## Datasets
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

The experiments are implemented on two main-stream **public** endoscopic datasets :file_folder: for self-supervised depth estimation and zero-shot depth estimation.
- **SCARED dataset**: Train/Validation/Evaluation [Website](https://endovissub2019-scared.grand-challenge.org/)

- **Hamlyn dataset**: Zero-shot Evaluation [Website](http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/)

_**Sincerely thanks for their great contributions to the community!!!**_
